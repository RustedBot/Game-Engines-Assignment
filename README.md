# Game-Engines-Assignment
For this assignment I will create generative art which is responsive to audio playback. The art will most likely be comprised of primitive shapes such as cubes and spheres. I am currently undecided but mathematical functions such as the sine wave may be used to move the shapes in a defined pattern, with the shapes themselves being transformed in response to the audio playback by for example changing colour, scale and rotation.
